  Dear User,

  Thanks for taking the time to be in my study!

  In the next 3 days, please take 5-10 minutes to evaluate both stories:

  1) Test 1

  2) Test 2

  Additionally:

  - Evaluate the stories in order (Test 1 then Test 2)
  - Please do not allow the first story to influence your judgement of the other
  - Take 5-10 minutes of uninterrupted time to do both of these
  - Evaluate the stories without consulting other people
  - Please don't view the source code (github, your browser). (At least until after evaluating.)
  - Works best on a computer (as opposed to ipad).

  You'll have to read the captions carefully, as they are pieced together by a computer program. 

  Please email me if you have any questions.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In additional to Test 1 and 2, I'm looking for feedback on the study itself. So, being the first trial, any feedback in response to this email will also be appreciated.
