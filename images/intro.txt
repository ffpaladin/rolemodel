Greetings,

I am the ROBOT DETECTIVE and I have sketched out the facts for this particular crime story. I have logically generated scenarios that fit different perspectives of these facts.

I need a human JUDGE to determine what has happened for each logically authored perspective. You can judge as many stories as you'd like, but please only use this information I give without being influenced by past perspectives.

If you are willing to be the JUDGE, 
                         then click this screen to begin the narration.

						Sincerely,
							ROBOT DETECTIVE
